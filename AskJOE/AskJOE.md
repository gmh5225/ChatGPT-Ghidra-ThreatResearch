# AskJOE

## What is AskJOE?
This is a Ghidra plugin that calls [OPENAI](https://openai.com/) to give meaning to decompiled functions. It was based on the [Gepetto](https://github.com/JusticeRage/Gepetto) idea.

This one is much more simple and instead work in IDA Pro we can use it to get some insights in Ghidra! :)
